Front-end Preprocessing: Yosys reads, parses the RTL code and generates an internal representation of the design
Elaboration: Yosys produces a netlist includes logic gates and higher-level constructs such as flip-flops 
Coarse-grain Synthesis: Yosys translates the RTL into a gate-level netlist. 
Technology Mapping: Yosys uses ABC to map the optimized netlist to a specific target technology

Step - 1: load the target technology library
IHP-SG13G2 technology library, a 130nm CMOS process

Yosys only partially supports constraints through the external ABC technology mapping tool. There are three key types of constraints you can define:

Clock Period: Maximum allowed clock period for the design.
Driving Cell: Type of cell used to drive the primary inputs of the design.
Output Load: The capacitive load that each output of the design will drive.


Different timing paths
the data paths of a sequential circuit can be subdivided into four categories with regard to their timings:

t_ss: From state-holding registers to state-holding registers (s -> s),
t_is: From input to state-holding registers (i -> s),
t_so: From state-holding registers to output (s -> o),
t_io: From input to output (i -> o).


Propagation delay in CMOS circuits is critically influenced by the capacitive load that the output drives. 
A higher load capacitance means it takes longer for the output to charge or discharge, directly increasing 
the delay and affecting signal propagation speed. Using the buffer cellâ€™s input capacitance as a proxy for 
the load is a common practice because it reliably represents the effective capacitive load seen by the driving cell. 
Refer to the standard cell documentation, we can find for example, the input pin capacitance of sg13g2_buf_8 is 0.0086pF, 
and sg13g2_buf_16 is 0.0171pF.

In many cases, designers choose a higher capacitance value to ensure that timing constraints are met even under 
worst-case loading conditions.
